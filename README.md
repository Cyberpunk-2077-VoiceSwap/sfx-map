# Cyberpunk 2077 SFX map

> Map of SFX events and their audio files in Cyberpunk 2077.

**Last update:** Patch 2.01 + Phantom Liberty DLC

- This repository contains a file named `sfx_map.json`.
- It contains all SFX events, their tags and info about the audio files the event triggers.
- Info about the audio files (if found) includes in which opuspak and where in the opuspak the audio is.

I hope this file helps you find the sound effects you want to extract!  
Happy modding!
