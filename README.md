# Cyberpunk 2077 SFX map

**I WILL NO LONGER UPDATE THIS REPOSITORY!**  
GitHub's limits on bandwidth are too limiting.  
Use <https://cp-sfx.zhincore.eu/> for searching SFX and subtitles instead!

## Old readme

> Map of SFX events and their audio files in Cyberpunk 2077.
> **NEW**: Map of subtitles and their audio voiceover.

**Last update:** Patch 2.1 + Phantom Liberty DLC

- This repository contains a file named `sfx_map.json`.
  - It contains all SFX events, their tags and info about the audio files the event triggers.
  - Info about the audio files (if found) includes in which opuspak and where in the opuspak the audio is.
- **Newly** this repository also contains `subtitles.json`!
  - This file contains mapping of voiceover files to their EN-US subtitles.
  - **Note:** The same subtitle may exist for holocall and non-holocall audio, bear that in mind!

I hope this file helps you find the sound effects you want to extract!  
Happy modding!
